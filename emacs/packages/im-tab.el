;;;; Save window configurations to a predefined keybinding ephemerally

;; When I work with a specific feature, I generally set up a window
;; configuration for that but of course that changes pretty quickly
;; when you look up for something or some buffer pops up and destroys
;; your configuration.  These changes can be moderated with
;; `tab-bar-history-back' and `tab-bar-history-forward' and you can
;; return to your specific setup.  But sometimes, the yak shaving goes
;; too deep and your specific window configuration is buried deep
;; inside your `tab-bar-history' or it's even completely lost.  Also
;; it is not a very pleasant experience to go back and forth for a
;; specific configuration.  The following configuration solves this.
;; It let's you assign specific window configuration to specific keys
;; and restore them with those specific keys.

(defvar im-tab-configuration (make-hash-table :test 'equal :size 20))

;;;###autoload
(defun im-tab-configuration-save-current ()
  "Save current window configuration to a key.

  This function saves the window configuration using `last-input-event'.
It is advised to bind this function to a key chords like

  C-x w w {1,2,3,4...}

so that you can retrieve with same number keys later.  Assuming you
bind `im-tab-configuration-restore-current' to:

  C-x w {1,2,3,4...}

Now you will be able to save the window configuration for the current
tab with \"C-x w w 1\" and then retrieve it back with \"C-x w 1\" in the
same tab.  Configurations are saved per tab."
  (interactive)
  (let* ((current-tab (alist-get 'current-tab (funcall tab-bar-tabs-function)))
         (name (alist-get 'name current-tab))
         (explicit-name? (alist-get 'explicit-name current-tab))
         (cfg (concat name (char-to-string last-input-event))))
    (unless explicit-name?
      (user-error "This function does not work on unnamed tabs"))
    (map-put!
     im-tab-configuration
     cfg
     (current-window-configuration))
    (message ">> Configuration saved as %s" cfg)))
