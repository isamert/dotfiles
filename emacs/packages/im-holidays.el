;; Turkish and Dutch holiday definitions for Emacs calendar.

;;;; Usage

;; You probably would like to something like:
;;
;;   (setq calendar-holidays (append im-holidays-dutch-holidays im-holidays-turkish-holidays))
;;
;; Now you can use M-x holidays, or M-x holiday-list and see the
;; proper holidays.
;;
;; To display holidays marked in M-x calendar, do:
;;
;;   (setq calendar-mark-holidays-flag t)

;;; Code:
