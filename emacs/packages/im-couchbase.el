;; Integrate Couchbase N1QL with sql.el and add `org-babel' support
;; for n1ql.
;;
;; * sql.el support
;;
;; It's not very polished, currently it can't highlight the JSON
;; output but the interactive window.
;;
;; You simply need to add a definition like following to
;; `sql-connection-alist':
;;
;;     ("<connection-name>"
;;         (sql-product 'n1ql)
;;         (sql-server   "http://<server-ip>:8091")
;;         (sql-user     "<user>")
;;         (sql-password "<password>"))
;;
;; Now you can do `sql-connect' and connect to "<connection-name>".
;;
;; This requires cbq binary to be in the PATH.  On MacOS, if you have
;; installed couchbase-server-community with brew, then cbq binary is
;; somehwere around:
;;
;;     /Applications/Couchbase Server.app/Contents/Resources/couchbase-core/bin/cbq
;;
;; Add this to PATH and you are good to go.
;;
;;
;; * org-babel support
;;
;; Unfortunately `ob-sql' is not very extensible, hence a new mode
;; called n1ql is introduced.
;;
;; Following should work:
;;
;;     #+begin_src n1ql :dbconnection 'dbcon
;;     select * from `bucket` limit 1;
;;     #+end_src
;;
;; where 'dbcon is from `sql-connection-alist'.  Alternatively you can
;; use:
;;
;;     #+begin_src n1ql :server "..." :user "..." :password "..."
;;     select * from `bucket` limit 1;
;;     #+end_src
;;
;; or combination of both:
;;
;;
;;     #+begin_src n1ql :dbconnection 'someconn  :user "..."
;;     select * from `bucket` limit 1;
;;     #+end_src
;;
;; where :user parameter from the block shadows the one from the
;; :dbconnection.
