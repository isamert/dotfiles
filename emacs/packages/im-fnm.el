;; Switch Node versions with FNM in Emacs.  Simply do M-x
;; `im-fnm-use'.

;;; Code:

(defun im-fnm--ensure ()

  (unless (getenv "FNM_DIR")
    (let ((fnm-env (json-parse-string
                    (shell-command-to-string "fnm env --json")
                    :object-type 'alist)))
      (message "Initializing FNM...")
      (dolist (it fnm-env)
